# SangConnect - Blood Donation Platform

## Project Overview
SangConnect is a **web application** designed to modernize and digitalize blood donation processes in Morocco.  

It provides two main interfaces:  
- **Front Office (ReactJS + Spring Boot)**: for general users (donors/requesters) and center managers. Users can view blood requests, participate in donations, and manage their profiles. Center managers can monitor requests and track activities via a dashboard.  
- **Back Office (Spring Boot + Thymeleaf)**: for system administrators, providing full control over users, centers, blood requests, and reporting.

The platform is **secure** (JWT authentication, HTTPS), responsive, and built for reliability and performance.

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Git  
- Node.js (18+) and npm

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/SangConnect.git
cd SangConnect
```
The repository contains three main folders:

- front-office-react

- front-office-api

-  back-office

### 2. Configure the database

Create Oracle XE database if not already available.

Run SQL scripts in database-scripts/ to create tables and initial data.

Update backend configuration (application.properties):
``` bash
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:XE
spring.datasource.username=YOUR_DB_USERNAME
spring.datasource.password=YOUR_DB_PASSWORD
```

### 3. Start the backend
``` bash
cd back-office
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```
The backend will run on port 8081 by default.

### 4. Start the frontend
``` bash
cd front-office-react
npm install
npm start
```
The frontend will be accessible at http://localhost:3000
.

âš  Ensure the backend is running first, so the frontend can interact with APIs.
``` bash
cd front-office-api
mvn spring-boot:run
```
The backend runs on port 8080 by default.
